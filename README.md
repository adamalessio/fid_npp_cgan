# Near-pair patch generative adversarial network with FID loss

A repository for sharing some of the models presented in our [paper]().

The models were trained in Matlab.  We share models through the [ONNX](https://onnx.ai) format and provide an notebook file for demonstrating use on reprentative fracture absent patches.  

We are not able to share the original pediatric radiographs used in this work due to IRB limitations.
